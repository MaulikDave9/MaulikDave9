Hi, This is Maulik, I am aspiring Data Scientist/Software Developer.

I am passionate about Computer Vision projects with Deep Learning technology. And recently implemented Multi-class Image Classification on Fruits-360 Dataset:

I am focusing on building skills with PyTorch framework For Deep Learning in Spring 2026. 

I finished Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate with Coursera in 2025. 
It focused on the statistical analysis, Python, regression models, and machine learning.
