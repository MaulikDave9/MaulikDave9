Hi, This is Maulik, I am aspiring Data Scientist/Software Developer.

I am passionate about Computer Vision and Deep Learning. Recently I implemented Multi-class Image Classification on the Kaggle Fruits-360 Dataset:

Currently, I am focusing on building skills with PyTorch framework For Deep Learning, pursuing Coursera Certification "PyTorch with Deep Learning".

I finished Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate (Coursera) in 2025. 
It focused on the statistical analysis, Python, regression models, and machine learning.
